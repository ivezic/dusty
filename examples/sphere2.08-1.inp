    Input data for DUSTY                                               
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 This is an input file for radiative transfer code DUSTY, version 2.07. 
 NOTE: this input file is not compatible with old versions of Dusty 
 due to the added new input options. Examples of each input option are 
 given at the end of this file. For a more detailed description please 
 refer to the Manual. 
 
 This input file has a free format. Text and empty lines can be entered
 arbitrarily. The occurrence of relevant numerical input, which is 
 entered in standard FORTRAN conventions, is flagged by the equal sign.  
 The only restrictions are that all required input entries must be 
 specified, and in the correct order; the most likely source of an input
 error is failure to comply with these requirements.  Single entries are
 always preceded by the equal sign and terminated by a blank, which can 
 be optionally preceded with a punctuation mark. Some input is entered 
 as a list, in which case only the first member is preceded by the equal
 sign, while each following member must be preceded by a blank (a comma 
 followed by a blank can be entered for additional separation). Because 
 of the special role of the equal sign as a flag for input entry, care 
 must be taken not to introduce any equal signs except when required. 
 All text following the `%' sign is ignored (as in TeX) and this can be 
 used to comment out material that includes equal signs. All lines that 
 start with the `*' sign are echoed in the output.

	flag.eq.2 each model result is in a separate corresponding file, 
	with visibilities contained in fname.i##. If the images flag.eq.3 
	the visibilities will be in separate files fname.v## (the flag for 
	visibilities has to be the same as for images).

  II. PHYSICAL PARAMETERS                       
                            
   1) Source(s) - here the user chooses the sources illuminating 
   the spherical shell (plane-parallel slab). 1 is for source presence;
   0 for source absence. Example:

        central = 1       external = 0
                                                                      
  1.1 Central Source Radiation
      Six input options, flag selected, are available. Three involve 
      entry in analytical form: (1) a combination of black-bodies, 
      (2) a modified black body as Engelke-Marengo function, and 
      (3) broken power law. The other three are for entry in numerical 
	  form as a separate user-supplied input file which lists either 
	  (4) lambda*F_lambda (= nu*F_nu), (5) F_lambda or (6) F_nu vs. lambda. 
	  Here lambda is wavelength in microns, and nu is the corresponding 
	  frequency. F_lambda or F_nu is the external flux density in arbitrary 
	  units. Examples of the different options are as follows:
   
      (1) Two black bodies, e.g. a binary system:
                Spectrum =  1                
            Number of BB =  2                
            Temperatures = 10000, 2500 K   
            Luminosities = 4, 1              

      (2) Modified black body spectrum using Engelke-Marengo function
                Spectrum = 3                  
                     Tbb = 2500 K                  
       SiO feature depth = 10.0 % 
	   
      (3) A flat spectrum confined between 0.1 and 1.0 microns:
                Spectrum = 2                  
                       N = 1                  
                  lambda = 0.1, 1 micron      
                       k = 0                  

      (4) Spectrum tabulated in file AGN.dat:
                Spectrum = 4          % in lamF_lam units  
                 AGN.dat

      Options (5) and (6) are entered analogously to option (4).
                                                                        
      Input of spectral shape is followed by boundary condition - 
	  either dust temperature at r1 (type of entry = 1) or input flux 
	  (type of entry = 2, 3 or 4). If spectrum is from a file its bol.flux 
	  is found from the file and the ONLY other input is type of entry=1 
	  (i.e. T1) , or 2 (normalization factor).
	  Examples of the two options are as follows:    

	  Scale:   
	  (1) Td at the inner boundary : 
	           type of entry = 1     
                          Td = 1000   K

	  (2) External flux at the inner boundary in W/m^2: 
	           type of entry = 2     
                          Fi = 1.0e4 W/m2
	  
	  (3) Luminosity of the central source (in units of Lo)
	      and its distance to the inner boundary (r1, in cm): 
	           type of entry = 3     
                           L = 1.0e4  Lo
                          r1 = 1.0e14 cm

	  (4) effective temperature corresponding to the bol. flux at r1: 
	            type of entry = 4     
                           Te = 600   K


  1.2 External Source Radiation
      The external radiation is considered isotropic and specified by 
	  its spectral shape and energy density. Analitical spectral profiles
	  are entered in the same way as for the central source. Then the 
	  scale is given by either 
	  (1) the mean intensity value Jo in [W/m2]
	  	 Example:
         Scale:         type of entry = 1         % Jext value
                                 Jext = 1.0e-05    W/m2
      or, 
	  (2) dilution factor W, if the source parameters are chosen as a 
	  black body. For a combination of black-bodies the dilution factor 
	  refers to the highest luminosity black body, since their relative 
	  luminosities are given. 
	     Example:
         Spectral shape:     Spectrum = 1  
                         Number of BB = 2
                          Temperature = 10000  ,  4000 K 
                Relative Luminosities = 1, 22            

               Scale:   type of entry = 2         % dilution factor
                                    W = 1.0e-13    
   
	  If the spectrum is from a file(in SI units) there is only one 
	  option for type of entry=2 (normalization factor_, allowing scaling 
	  the spectrum up or down; if Norm=1 the file is taken as it is.
      
	  Example of external source with data for the Interstellar 
	  radiation field in file 'ISRF.dat'. Jo is found from the file and 
	  multiplied by 20:

         Spectral shape:     Spectrum = 4  
                               ISRF.dat						              
         Scale:         type of entry = 2   % norm. factor for spectrum
                                 Norm = 20  % 
        
      

   2) Dust Properties
      Dust optical properties are determined by the sizes of the grains 
      and by their absorption and scattering efficiencies, which depend 
      also on the grain material. The grains chemical composition is 
      specified first, followed by the size distribution and the dust 
      temperature at the inner boundary.

   2.1 Chemical composition                                          
      
      DUSTY contains data for the optical properties of 6 common grain 
      types. Optical properties for additional grains can be supplied by
      the user.  In this case, the user can either specify directly the 
      absorption and scattering coefficients or have DUSTY calculate 
      them from provided index of refraction. Examples:

      (1) Mixture containing only dust grains with built-in data for
          optical properties:

                Optical properties index = 1
                Abundances for supported grain types:
                Sil-Ow  Sil-Oc  Sil-DL  grf-DL  amC-Hn   SiC-Pg 
            x =  0.00    0.00    0.53    0.47    0.00     0.00

      (2) Three additional grain types with the refractive index 
          provided by the user in data files amC-zb1.nk, amC-zb2.nk and
          amC-zb3.nk:
                Optical properties index = 2
                Abundances for supported grain types:
                Sil-Ow  Sil-Oc  Sil-DL  grf-DL  amC-Hn   SiC-Pg 
            x =  0.00    0.00    0.00    0.35    0.00     0.00

          Number of additional components = 3, properties listed in:
                     amC-zb1.nk
                     amC-zb2.nk
                     amC-zb3.nk
          Abundances for these components = 0.45, 0.10, 0.23 
       
      (3) Absorption and scattering cross sections from the file 
          ism-stnd.dat (in this case skip the entry for size distribution)

          Optical properties index = 3; cross-sections entered in file
                   ism-stnd.dat 
 
   2.2 Grain size distribution                                             
                                                                        
      The grain size distribution must be specified only when the 
      previous option was set to 1 or 2.  When the dust cross sections 
      are read from a file previous option set at 3, the present option 
      is skipped. Examples:
      
      (1) Standard MRN distribution. No input required other than the
          option flag.
          
          Size distribution = 1
 
      (2) Modified MRN distribution. The option flag is followed by 
          listing of the power index, q, lower limit a(min) and upper 
          limit a(max) in microns.

          Size distribution = 2
          q = 3.5, a(min) = 0.005 micron, a(max) = 0.25 micron 

      (3) KMH distribution. The option flag is followed by a list of 
          the power index, q, lower limit a(min) and the characteristic 
          size a0 in microns
          
          Size distribution = 3
          q = 3.5, a(min) = 0.005 micron, a0 = 0.2 micron

                                             
   3) Density Distribution - only for spherical shell
      DUSTY provides 3 methods for entering the density distribution: 
      prescribed analytical forms, hydrodynamic calculation of winds 
      driven by radiation pressure on dust particles, and numerical 
      tabulation in a file. Examples:                                          
                                              
      (1) Broken power law:                                        

                   density type = 1
                              N = 3
               transition radii =   10   100    1000
               power indices    =    2     1       0   
          
          Or for a single power-law:
          
               density type = 1; N = 1; Y = 1000; p = 2
          
                                              
      (2) Exponentially decreasing density distribution:

               density type = 2; Y = 100; sigma = 4                                    
                                                        
      (3) Full numerical solution for radiatively driven winds:

               density type = 3;     Y = 1.e4                                             
                                                        
                                                        
      (4) Analytical approximation for radiatively driven winds:

               density type = 4;     Y = 10000.0                                           
                                                        
                                                        
      (5) Density profile tabulated in a file:

               density type = 5;  profile supplied in the file 
               collapse.dat
      
   4) Optical Depth
                            
      For a given set of the parameters specified above, DUSTY can 
      generate up to 999 models covering a range of optical depths tau0, 
      specified at some fiducial wavelength lambda0. DUSTY will cover 
      this range taking either linear or logarithmic steps. The user 
      specifies the grid type: 1 for linear, 2 for logarithmic and 3 for 
      tau-grid from a file. This is followed by lambda0, the end points of 
      the tau0 range and the number of grid points. In the case of file  
      supplied grid the only entry is the file name. Example:

                grid type = 2               % logarithmic
                lambda0 = 0.55 micron
                tau(min) = 0.1; tau(max) = 10
                number of models = 3
                           
                            
  III) NUMERICAL ACCURACY
                            
     The numerical accuracy and convergence of DUSTY calculations are 
     controlled by a parameter specifying the required accuracy of 
     bolometric flux conservation, qacc.  The radial grid is refined 
     until the relative error of flux conservation at every point of 
     the radial grid is less than qacc. Whenever DUSTY calculates also 
     the density profile, the numerical accuracy of that calculation is 
     controlled by the same parameter.  The recommended value is:
     
          qacc = 0.05                           
                            
                            
  IV) OUTPUT CONTROL FLAGS                       
                                                        
     A typical DUSTY run generates an enormous amount of information, 
     and the user is in control of the volume of output. For an input
     file fname.inp the default output is written to fname.out. 
     Additional output can be controlled by five flags that turn on and
     off the tabulation of various quantities for each of the optical 
     depths included in the run. If flag = 0 the particular file(s) is 
	 not produced. If flag = 1 all model results are in the corresponding 
	 file with extension 'stb' for spectra, 'itb' for images and visibilities 
	 (if chosen), 'rtb' for radial profiles and 'mtb' for messages. If 
	 flag = 2 each model result is in  a corresponding file, with visibilities 
	 contained in fname.i###. If the images flag = 3 the visibilities will be 
	 in separate files fname.v### .The visibility flag must be the same as the 
	 images flag. The sp.properties of all model spectra are in the file 
	 fname.spp which is the same for any of the above flag values.

     For example, the set of flags below will will produce the following 
	 output files: sp.properties fname.spp; one file fname.stb with all model 
	 spectra; one file with images and visibilities fname.itb. The radial 
	 profiles and messages for all models will be in fname.rtb and fname.mtb.

       ------------------------------------------------------------     
       - properties of emerging spectra;             fname.spp = 1     
       - detailed spectra for each model;           fname.s### = 1   
       - images at specified wavelengths;           fname.i### = 1  
         If this flag is set to 1, here specify these wavelengths: 
         the first entry is the number of such wavelengths (<20), 
         followed by a list of these wavelengths in microns.                             
         number of wavelengths  = 8                                                 
         wavelengths = 0.55, 1, 2.2, 4, 10, 50, 100, 1000 microns   
         If the flag is set to 0 delete the above two lines, or 
         delete the equal signs.                                 
       - visibility function at spec. wavelengths;  fname.v### = 1                                        
       - radial profiles for each model;            fname.r### = 1   
       - detailed run-time messages;                fname.m### = 1
